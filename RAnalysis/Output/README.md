# About:
 This repository contains original data in the project titled "Wild scallop population resilience: Using multigenerational studies to estimate robustness and adaptive potential to rapidly changing ocean acidification".
 Housed in this repository are all larvae data from fertilization to metamorphosis, when aniamls were reared under static larval systems and before moved to flow-through downwellers.
 We decided upon **four manuscripts** for these data, outlined below:

# Manuscripts (drafting):

### (1) 'Survival and Growth'

 **about**: *How does OA affect scallop survival and growth to metamorphosis?*

 **data**
  - survival
  - size / growth data from D-hinge to metamorphosis

 **experiment #s**: 2 and 4

### (2) 'Dstage shell abnormalities'

 **about**: *How does OA affect scallops to D-stage? Does parental exposure to OA improve the immediate larval development?*

 **data**
  - D-stage abnormality

 **experiment #s**: 1, 2 and 4

### (3) 'F2 full factorial'

 **about**: *How does parental exposure affect early development (embryo to D stage development)?*

 **data**
  - D-stage abnormality
  - *Note* we also have respiration rate data here

 **experiment #s**: 3

### (4) 'F3 full factorial'

 **about**: *How does parental exposure affect early development (embryo to D stage development)?*

 **data**
  - survival
  - size / growth data, both prior to and after metamorphosis
  - D-stage abnormality
  - metamorphosis
  - *Note* we also have respiration rate data here
  - gene expression *may be included in own manuscript?*

 **experiment #s**: 6


# Experiment numbers

* Focus of this repository on **six experiments!** dubbed as column names **'Run'**

  - (1) F1 larvae under three OA levels, *no grow out*
    - July 2021

  - (2) F1 larvae under three OA levels, *grown out to adult stage*
    * **Note:** Few F1 under high OA reached adulthood, were exhausted for experiments 3 and 5
    - July 2021

  - (3) F2 larvae full cross 3 x 3 parent x offspring OA, *no grow out*
    - April 2022

  - (4) F2 larvae under two OA levels, *grown out to adult stage*
    * **Important!!** The F1 low pCO2 juveniles were divided to grow out a high pCO2 cohort for 1 generation!
      - August 2022

  - (5) F2 larvae under 3 x 3 parent x offspring OA, *no grow out*
    * **Note:** Repeated trial, *however* the high pCO2 offspring treatment is confounded by a chemistry error,
    we may solely use a 3 x 2 framework here (3 parental pCO2 x 2 offspring pCO2; low and moderate only!)
      - March 2023

  - (6) F3 larvae under 3 x 3 parent x offsring OA, *no grow out past juvenile takedown of the experiment*
    * **Note:** Refer to the note below experiment #4 for the presence of 3 pCO2 F2 broodstock in this experiment (thumbs up!)
      - May 2023
