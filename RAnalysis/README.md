# About:
 This repository contains original data in the project titled "Wild scallop population resilience: Using multigenerational studies to estimate robustness and adaptive potential to rapidly changing ocean acidification"

# Manuscripts (drafting):

### (1) 'Survival and Growth'

 **about**: *How does OA affect scallop survival and growth to metamorphosis?*

 **data**
  - survival
  - size / growth data from D-hinge to metamorphosis

 **experiment #s**: 2 and 4

### (2) 'Dstage shell abnormalities'

 **about**: *How does OA affect scallops to D-stage? Does parental exposure to OA improve the immediate larval development?*

 **data**
  - D-stage abnormality

 **experiment #s**: 1, 2 and 4

### (3) 'F2 full factorial'

 **about**: *How does parental exposure affect early development (embryo to D stage development)?*

 **data**
  - D-stage abnormality
  - *Note* we also have respiration rate data here
 **experiment #s**: 3

### (4) 'F3 full factorial'

 **about**: *How does parental exposure affect early development (embryo to D stage development)?*

 **data**
  - survival
  - size / growth data, both prior to and after metamorphosis
  - D-stage abnormality
  - metamorphosis
  - *Note* we also have respiration rate data here
  - gene expression *may be included in own manuscript?*

 **experiment #s**: 6

# Experiment numbers

* Focus of this repository on **six experiments!** dubbed as column names **'Run'**

  - (1) F1 larvae under three OA levels, *no grow out*
    - July 2021

  - (2) F1 larvae under three OA levels, *grown out to adult stage*
    * **Note:** Few F1 under high OA reached adulthood, were exhausted for experiments 3 and 5
    - July 2021

  - (3) F2 larvae full cross 3 x 3 parent x offspring OA, *no grow out*
    - April 2022

  - (4) F2 larvae under two OA levels, *grown out to adult stage*
    * **Important!!** The F1 low pCO2 juveniles were divided to grow out a high pCO2 cohort for 1 generation!
      - August 2022

  - (5) F2 larvae under 3 x 3 parent x offspring OA, *no grow out*
    * **Note:** Repeated trial, *however* the high pCO2 offspring treatment is confounded by a chemistry error,
    we may solely use a 3 x 2 framework here (3 parental pCO2 x 2 offspring pCO2; low and moderate only!)
      - March 2023

  - (6) F3 larvae under 3 x 3 parent x offsring OA, *no grow out past juvenile takedown of the experiment*
    * **Note:** Refer to the note below experiment #4 for the presence of 3 pCO2 F2 broodstock in this experiment (thumbs up!)
      - May 2023


### /RAnalysis/Data

 Folder contains the following data for larvae *A. irradiains* under OA treatments:

* D-stage percent abnormalities

	- the F2 and F3 crossed experiments are here
	- raw data file also contains several 'runs' that do not apply for this repo

* survival

	- only the F3 crossed experiments here
	- raw data file also contains F1 (generation 1) and F2 (generation 2) for grow out that does not apply for this repo

* shell growth

	- only the F3 crossed experiments here
	- raw data file also contains F1 (generation 1) and F2 (generation 2) for grow out that does not apply for this repo

* respiration rate

	- to be transferred.. currently in the Airradians_multigen_OA repository

* metamorphosis of larvae

 	- only the F3 crossed experiments here
	- raw data file also contains F2 (generation 2) data for grow out that does not apply for this repo


#### notes:
- the repository initiated in **12/18/2023** and contains some larvae physiology data from the  multigenerational grow out (not for this repo) and some data to be processed
