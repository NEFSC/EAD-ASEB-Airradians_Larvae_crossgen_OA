## About seawater chemistry 

**workbook** 

* excel files with tabs, these include the raw populated file that Genevieve and Shannon added to why accumulating data
this includes all tanks and carb chem cals as DIC pH, TA DIC, and pH TA

* Shannon investigated the large differences inTA
between generations, due to this she assembled a master file with TA DIC to calculate carbonate chemistry 

**raw** 

* Sam worked up chemistry from excel files to csv formatted for R, this was initialy carb chem calculated using
 DI+pH as the gold standard
 
* as mentioned for the workbooks, Shannon investigated the large differences in TA
between generations, due to this she assembled a master file with TA DIC to calculate carbonate chemistry - 
the raw file includes the means and standard deviations fromthe master file made by Meseck in 8.2024
